    <p>The main objective was to design a modal that allowed members to use an offer by clicking to either learn more or book online. I made this main action stand out by making it a stark blue against white backgrounds.</p>
    <p>Because many AARP members prefer to speak to someone for assistance, the phone number was also given the blue color.</p>

Multiple variants of visualizing the time remaining until the each offer expires. After testing, we learned that the variant with 'Days left' performed the best. This was due to the fact that the 'Expires on' variant created a higher cognitive load on the user—as they had to calculate the current date and then the days until the expiration day.

'Days left' is also dynamic as opposed to the static 'Expires on'. The number reduces each day creating a sense of scarcity increasing the urge of the user to take advantage of the offer.
