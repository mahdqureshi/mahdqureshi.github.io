## Background

While there are a ton of services for content creators, one market that felt underserved was Nutrition and Dietitian coaches. They’re forced to juggle multiple services like TikTok, Email, Texts, etc.

The goal of Macros was to create a platform that had all the content creation value of a TikTok and YouTube, while integrating all the value of subscription platforms like Substack. A place where you could share and discover great food and nutrition content, while also offering private memberships for more one-on-one coaching.

## Brand

The name Macros was inspired by the common shorthand for macronutrients—Protein, Carbohydrates, and Fats. “If It Fits Your Macros” is a common saying in fitness circles, meaning if any meal fits your macronutrient goals for the day, then you can safely eat it. Yes, even ice cream.

From there, I began work on the logomark. I noticed that macro ratios were commonly illustrated using a pie chart, with each nutrient taking up a percentage of the chart. The percentage symbol stuck out as something universal, yet still unique and ownable.
