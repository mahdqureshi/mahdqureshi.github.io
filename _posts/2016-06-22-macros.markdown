## Background

In 2021, the creator economy was seen as the next big wave, with services like Substack experiencing anomalous growth. The idea that micro-creators could now capitalize on their audience, especially the long tail of them, was super compelling.

One significant gap in the market was in the “Dietitians & Nutritionists” space. Millions of people seek diet and food guidance, but struggle to actually get it. And the specialists that can provide it encounter friction in finding potential clients and managing their interactions. Most of them still text message clients and email them PDF meal plans made manually.

The goal of Macros was to create a platform that had all the content pros of a TikTok and YouTube, while integrating all the pros of subscription platforms like Substack. A place where users could discover high-quality food and nutrition content and access individualized coaching through memberships.

## Brand

The name Macros was inspired by the common shorthand for macronutrients—Protein, Carbohydrates, and Fats. “If It Fits Your Macros” is a common saying in fitness circles, meaning if any meal fits your macronutrient goals for the day, then you can safely eat it. Yes, even ice cream.

From there, I began work on the logomark. I noticed that macro ratios were commonly illustrated using a pie chart, with each nutrient taking up a percentage of the chart. The percentage symbol stuck out as something universal, yet still unique and ownable.
