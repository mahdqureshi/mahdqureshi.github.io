intro: Macros is a platform for food creatives and nutrition coaches to create content and manage their clients. As the founder and designer, I led the initial market and user research, designed the end-to-end experience, hired the team, and led the go-to-market strategy.

## Background

While there are a ton of services for content creators, one market that felt underserved was nutrition coaches. Forced to juggle multiple services, with many still using old-school, manual processes like emailing a client meal plans made in a Google Doc, and then communicating with them via basic texting. Not very high leverage.

The goal of Macros was to create a platform that had the intuitive content creation tools of platforms like TikTok, while integrating the subscription value of platforms like Substack. A place where coaches could share and discover awesome food and nutrition content, while also offering private memberships for more one-on-one coaching.

## Brand

The name Macros was inspired by the common shorthand for macronutrients—Protein, Carbohydrates, and Fats. “If It Fits Your Macros” is a common saying in fitness circles, meaning if any meal fits your macronutrient goals for the day, then you can safely eat it. Yes, even ice cream.

From there, I began work on the logomark. Macronutrient ratios were commonly illustrated using a pie chart, with each nutrient taking up a percentage of the chart. The percentage symbol stuck out as a glyph that could be universal, yet still unique and ownable.
