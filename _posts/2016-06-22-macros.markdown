## Background

In 2021, the creator economy was seen as the next big wave, with apps like Substack experiencing anomalous growth. The idea that micro-creators could now capitalize on their audience, especially the long tail of them, was super compelling.

After researching the market and interviewing various creators, one area of whitespace clearly stood out to me within the “Food nutritionists and Dietitians” space. I heard from many creators: “I do the same thing over and over, it’s so time consuming”. A majority of them juggled multiple apps in a clunky process—from communicating with clients from their personal text messages, to emailing meal plans as a PDF manually made in a Google Doc. They also tried apps like TikTok, but growing an audience and converting them into paid subscribers was full of friction.

What if we could create a platform that had all the pros of TikTok and YouTube, while integrating all the pros of subscription platforms like Substack? A place where you could share and discover great food and nutrition content, and also offer memberships for more one-on-one coaching. After receiving positive feedback from creators, I sought out to build it.

## Brand

The name Macros was inspired by the common shorthand for macronutrients—Protein, Carbohydrates, and Fats. “If It Fits Your Macros” is a common saying in fitness circles, meaning if any meal fits your macronutrient goals for the day, then you can safely eat it. Yes, even ice cream.

From there, I began work on the logomark. I noticed that macro ratios were commonly illustrated using a pie chart, with each nutrient taking up a percentage of the chart. The percentage symbol stuck out as something universal, yet still unique and ownable.
