    <p>When attending a trade show, you invariably go home with hundreds of paper business cards that you must then scan or manually enter into a digital repository. Most of these cards get thrown away—and along with it, a potential business relationship. </p>

    <p>The goal with Showcase was to remove this friction and allow you to instantly exchange your entire portfolio and contact information just by touching phones.</p>

Users can also send their card to anyone in the vicinity without touching phones—making it easy to share their information with multiple people at once.

Utilizing motion keeps the card in view when transitioning between screens. I did this to reinforce the mental model that the card is a container of information, rather than just a thumbnail for a different screen.

A glyph of a work lamp is inspired by glass showcases in which objects are displayed in their best light. The idea that you are sharing your best work in the app.
