## Exchange your entire portfolio just by touching phones and stay connected to the people you meet with Showcase. As Head of Design, I led the design process for all products across mobile, web, and marketing platforms.

    <h2 class="section-left">The Problem</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <p>When you attend a trade show, you invariably go home with hundreds of paper business cards that you must then scan or manually enter into a digital repository. Most of these cards get thrown away—and along with it, a potential business relationship. </p>

    <p>The goal with Showcase was to remove this friction and allow you to instantly exchange your entire portfolio and contact information just by touching phones.</p>

Users can also send their card to anyone in the vicinity without touching phones—making it easy to share their information with multiple people at once.
