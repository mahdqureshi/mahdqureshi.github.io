## An early iteration of the **[Showcase App](/showcase-app)** involved a web app in which designers could create and sell card designs.

<div class="caption">The designer can view their sales and earnings.</div>

## Once the designer put their design for sale, users on the mobile app could purchase the design and customize it with their information.

## After many iterations of the custom design store, it became clear that the designs were not reflective enough of the persons company. They also required a lot of work from the user in order to customize them. I decided to move towards a simpler, **[brand oriented approach.](/showcase-app)**
