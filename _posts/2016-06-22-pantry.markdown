  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-6">
  <p>Nutrition coaching is a fast growing career, but their tools have lagged behind. Meal plans still tediously created in Google Docs, emailed to clients as clunky PDFs. Coaching and support is then performed through personal text-messaging, which not only interrupts a coaches work-life balance, but also lacks a community feel for clients.</p>
  <p>Macros is an all-in-one platform to remove these friction points, providing value to both nutrition coaches and their clients. I was brought at the early stages, with my contributions starting at conducting user research all the way to working with engineering on a pixel perfect implementation.</p>
