intro: Macros is a modern platform for food creatives and nutrition coaches. Allowing them to meet and manage clients all in one place—with meal plans, 1-on-1 coaching, recipe discovery, and more. I led the end-to-end design for the platform.

  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-8">
  <p>Nutrition coaching is a fast growing career, but their tools have lagged behind. Meal plans still tediously created in Google Docs, emailed to clients as clunky PDFs. Coaching and support is then performed through personal text-messaging, which not only interrupts a coach's work-life balance, but also lacks a community feel for clients.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Macros is an all-in-one platform to remove these friction points, providing value to both nutrition coaches and their clients. I was brought on to lead the end-to-end design, from conducting user research to working with engineering on a pixel perfect implementation.</p>

    <h2 class="section-left">Research</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <p>
    The first phase in my research process was to conduct guerrilla user research to figure out who the users were and their goals. After researching, I was able to distill the user base down into three distinct personas.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    <strong>The Fitness Influencer</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    The fitness influencer is someone who is well known in the fitness/health community. They have a medium to large following on other platforms. They also have a sponsorships with health and fitness brands—which is key for us. We would be providing these users a way to market their sponsored products to consumers in a highly targeted way.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    <strong>The Fitness Enthusiast</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    The fitness enthusiast is a regular person who is getting into or is already following a health/fitness lifestyle. They are mostly looking to consume content—find healthy foods and supplements. These will be the user who follow the influencers that closely align with their own goals and then purchase products that will help them achieve those goals.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    <strong>The Brand</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    The brand is the manufacturer of a health food or supplement. Their main goal is to sell their products to users who would be repeat customers. With Pantry, we would be providing them with segmentation to target their products to the exact people who would use it.

  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <p>Once I had an idea of the core user base and their goals, I wanted to gain an understanding of the competitive landscape of health-diet apps.  I analyzed the top apps in the space to explore opportunities that might exist.</p>

<p class="project-body">There’s a diverse set of lifestyles and diets that are popular now — Keto, Paleo, Vegan, Dairy Free, Weight Loss/Gain, etc. After looking at the main players in the space, it was clear that no network exists that allows people to discuss and discover the best products & foods for their specific lifestyle.</p>
<p class="project-body">Once I had the list of major pain points, I could begin to ideate ways that we could address them in an elegant way.</p>

  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <p>Before I began the ideation phase for the visual layout of the app, I first defined a north star of success that would guide my design decisions. For Pantry, the major KPI’s that were to be monitored after deployment were:</p>
    <p style="font-weight: 500;">↗ Increase the number of users that add products to their profile.</p>
    <p style="font-weight: 500;">↗ Increase the number of followers that each user has.</p>
    <p style="font-weight: 500;">↗ Increase the number of clicks on the ‘Buy Product’ button.</p>
    <p style="font-weight: 500;">↗ Increase the number of product groups that users create within their pantry.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <p>The Pantry app lets users add a product to their ‘Macros’. Other users can follow you and view your ‘Macros’ to see which foods and products you are using—like a Pinterest board for foods and supplements.</p>
    <p>Initially the app had two main actions a user could take on a product.</p>
    <p>1. Add it to their own profile.</p>
    <p>2. Add it to their favorites.</p>
    <p>The initial wireframes had ‘Favorites’ as a main tab on the app with ‘Your Pantry’ being another.</p>

![pantry tab bar wireframe](/img/pantrytabwire.png)
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p class="project-body">When I tested this design with users, a major pain point was discovered. The differentiation between the purpose of ‘favorites’ and ‘your pantry’ wasn’t clear. Users didn’t know when to add a product to which. I had to clarify what the purpose of each action was.</p>


<p class="project-body">‘Your Pantry’ was designed to house products that you currently use, while ‘Favorites’ was for products that you’d like to use in the future. After making this distinction, it was clear that ‘Favorites’ wasn't an optimal name for a product you’ve never used. ‘Wish list’ made more sense in our case.</p>


<p class="project-body">I tested a version with ‘Wish List’ and while it performed better, users were still confused on when to add a product to their pantry vs to the wish list. I had to rethink the entire information architecture of the app.</p>
<p class="project-body">After trying out many iterations, I concluded that separating the two wasn't ideal. There should only be one place on the app that houses products. Within ‘Your pantry’, products are grouped by category. I added a default group—pinned to the top of the list—called ‘Wish List’. Everyone has this group when they create an account.</p>

<br>

![pantry groups](/img/pantrygroups.jpg)

<br>
<p class="project-body">The user now has a single option—add a product to their pantry. They’re then able to select a group—with ‘Wish List’ being an option.</p>
<br>

![pantry groups](/img/select-pantry-group.jpg)

<br>
<p class="project-body">When I tested this variant, it out-performed all the others. There was less friction since the user only has one option — adding a product to their pantry. From there, they quickly understood what ‘Wish List’ was and how it was different than the other groups.</p>

    <p>The next steps would be validating the design by monitoring the relevant KPI’s. If certain metrics are not where we’d like them to be, I’d continue to refine the design by following a similar process—find the pain points, ideate on solutions, and test with users to validate that the most elegant solution is built.</p>

## Consistency

I created a component style library to establish consistency throughout the design. This made it easier for engineering and design to focus on building and solving problems rather than constantly reinventing the wheel.
