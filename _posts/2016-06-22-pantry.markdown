# Overview

I co-founded Macros in 2021. Macros was an app for nutritionists & food influencers to be able to create content and manage their subscriptions, all in one place. Basically, TikTok and Substack combined. As the design founder, I led the design end-to-end and also managed the product while working with 3 engineers.
