  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-6">
  <p>Pantry is an app that allows users to find out what other people are eating that are following the same lifestyle goals as them.</p>
  <p>I was brought on to the project in the early stages. The team had basic wireframes and idea of features the app should have. I was tasked with fleshing out and delivering the final UX/UI and branding. </p>

  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <p>My first step was the define a north star of success that would guide my design decisions. The major KPI’s that were to be monitored after deployment were:</p>
    <p style="font-weight: 500;">↗ Increase the number of users that add products to their profile.</p>
    <p style="font-weight: 500;">↗ Increase the number of follows that each has.</p>
    <p style="font-weight: 500;">↗ Increase the number of product groups that users create within their pantry.</p>

  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <p>
    The first phase in my research process was to conduct guerrilla user research to figure out the users and their goals. After researching, I was able to distill the user base down into three distinct personas.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>The Fitness Influencer</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    The fitness influencer is someone who is well known in the fitness/health community. They have a medium to large following on other platforms. They also have a sponsorships with health and fitness brands—which is key for us. We would be providing these users a way to market their sponsored products to consumers in a highly targeted way.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>The Fitness Enthusiast</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    The fitness enthusiast is a regular person who is getting into or is already following a health/fitness lifestyle. They are mostly looking to consume content—find healthy foods and supplements. These will be the user who follow the influencers that closely align with their own goals and then purchase products that will help them achieve those goals.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>The Brand</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    The brand is the manufacturer of a health food or supplement. Their main goal is to sell their products to users who would be repeat customers. With Pantry, we would be providing them with segmentation to target their products to the exact people who would use it.

  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <p>Once I had an idea if the core user base and their goals, I wanted to gain an understanding of the competitive landscape of health-diet apps.  I analyzed the top apps in the space to help reveal opportunities that existed.</p>
  </div>

<p class="project-body">There’s a diverse set of lifestyles and diets that are popular now — Keto, Paleo, Vegan, Dairy Free, Weight Loss/Gain, etc. Finding others that are following your same goals is difficult. After looking at the main players in the space, it was clear that no centralized network exists that allows people to discuss and share the best products & foods for their specific lifestyle goal.</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <h2 class="section-left">Refinement</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <p>The Pantry app lets users add a product to their ‘Pantry’. Other users can follow you and view your ‘Pantry’ to see which foods and products you are using—like a Pinterest board for foods and supplements.</p>
    <p>Initially the app had two main actions a user could take on a product.</p>
    <p>1. Add it to their own pantry.</p>
    <p>2. Add it to their favorites.</p>
    <p>The initial wireframes had ‘Favorites’ as a main tab on the app with ‘Your Pantry’ being another.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<br>

![pantry tab bar wireframe](/img/pantrytabwire.png)

<br>

<p class="project-body">When I tested this design with users, a major pain point was discovered. The differentiation between the purpose of ‘favorites’ and ‘your pantry’ wasn’t clear. Users didn’t know when to add a product to which. I had to clarify what the purpose of each action was.</p>


<p class="project-body">‘Your Pantry’ was designed to house products that you currently use, while ‘Favorites’ was for products that you’d like to use in the future. After making this distinction, it was clear that ‘Favorites’ was a sub-optimal name for a food/supplement you’ve never used. ‘Wish list’ made more sense in our case.</p>


<p class="project-body">I tested a version with ‘Wish List’ and while it performed better, users were still confused on when to add a product to their pantry vs to the wish list. I had to rethink the entire information architecture of the app.</p>
<p class="project-body">After trying out many iterations, I concluded that separating the two wasn't ideal. There should only be one place on the app that houses products. Within ‘Your pantry’, products are grouped by category. I added a default group—pinned to the top of the list—called ‘Wish List’. Everyone has this group when they create an account.</p>

<br>

<br>
<p class="project-body">The user now has a single option—add a product to their pantry. They’re then able to select a group—with ‘Wish List’ being an option.</p>

## Consistency

I created a component style library to establish consistency throughout the design. This made it easier for engineering and design to focus on building and solving problems rather than constantly reinventing the wheel.
