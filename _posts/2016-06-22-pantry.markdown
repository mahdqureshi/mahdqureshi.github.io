  <p>Nutrition coaching is a fast growing career, but their tools have lagged behind. Meal plans still tediously created in Google Docs, emailed to clients as clunky PDFs. Coaching and support is then performed through personal text-messaging, which not only interrupts a coaches work-life balance, but also lacks a community feel for clients.</p>

  <h2>Brand Consistency</h2>
  <p>I created a brand guideline early on so that any changes could be easily implemented. This also enabled the development team to build with semantic colors—making dark mode intergration a priority from the beginning.</p>

    <p>The next steps would be validating the design by monitoring the relevant KPI’s. If certain metrics are not where we’d like them to be, I’d continue to refine the design by following a similar process—find the pain points, ideate on solutions, and test with users to validate that the most elegant solution is built.</p>

## Consistency

I created a component style library to establish consistency throughout the design. This made it easier for engineering and design to focus on building and solving problems rather than constantly reinventing the wheel.
