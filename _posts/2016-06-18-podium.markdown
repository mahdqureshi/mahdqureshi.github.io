## Podium lets your team accomplish tasks during meetings on the apps you already use. As Chief Product Officer, I had end-to-end responsibility for all product design efforts.

I created a component style library to establish consistency throughout the design. This made it easier for engineering and myself to focus on building and solving problems rather than constantly reinventing the wheel.

The main screen of the app is the meeting page. This is where members can collaborate together on any app. Anyone can use their cursor to interact with the app.
