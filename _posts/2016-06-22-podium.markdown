## Podium lets your team accomplish tasks during meetings on the apps you already use. As Chief Product Officer, I had end-to-end responsibility for all product design efforts.

    <h2 class="section-left">The Problem</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-6">
  <p>While there are many great tools that ease the friction that comes with communicating with a remote team, there aren’t many that help you to collaborate. Video conferencing tools like Hangouts, Zoom, etc., allow you share control of your mouse with attendees—but the constant back and forth of control inhibits the work getting done.</p>

  <p>What if there was a ‘Google Docs’ type solution that allowed you have multiple people work on something at the same time? Our goal with Podium was to create exactly that. </p>

The main screen of the app is the meeting page. This is where members can collaborate together on any app at the same time. It was very important to get this core screen right.

## Consistency

I created a component style library to establish consistency throughout the design. This made it easier for engineering and design to focus on building and solving problems rather than constantly reinventing the wheel.
