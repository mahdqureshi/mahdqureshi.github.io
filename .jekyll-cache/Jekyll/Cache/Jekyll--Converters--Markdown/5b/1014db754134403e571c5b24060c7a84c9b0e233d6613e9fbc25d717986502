    <p>When attending a trade show, you invariably go home with hundreds of paper business cards that you must then scan or manually enter into a digital repository. Most of these cards get thrown awayâ€”and along with it, a potential business relationship. </p>

Users can also send their card to anyone in the vicinity without touching phonesâ€”making it easy to share their information with multiple people at once.

Utilizing motion keeps the card in view when transitioning between screens. I used this to reinforce a mental model that the card is a container of information, rather than simply a thumbnail for a different screen.</p>
